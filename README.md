🖇️ATM Simulation Project
🖇️Overview
The ATM Simulation Project is a Python-based application designed to replicate the fundamental functions of an Automated Teller Machine (ATM). This project showcases essential programming concepts and provides an intuitive interface for managing ATM transactions.

🖇️Features
The ATM simulation encompasses the following core functionalities:

Account Balance Inquiry: Enables users to verify their current account balance.
Cash Withdrawal: Allows users to withdraw cash from their account.
Cash Deposit: Enables users to deposit cash into their account.
PIN Change: Provides functionality for users to modify their PIN.
Transaction History: Displays a record of transactions performed by the user.

To set up the ATM simulation project on your local machine, follow these steps:

Clone the Repository: bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/atm-simulation.git

Navigate to the Project Directory: bash
   cd atm-simulation

Install Dependencies: This project does not require external libraries beyond standard Python libraries. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.

Run the Application : bash

   python atm_simulation.py

🖇️Usage
Upon executing the application, users will be prompted to enter their PIN. After successful authentication, users can select from available options to perform various transactions. The main menu will guide users through the following actions:

Check Balance
Withdraw Cash
Deposit Cash
Change PIN
